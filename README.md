Just sharing a few little website designs I upgraded from a little web design class I'm taking. Feel free to include ideas for future enhancements.

Pacific is the basis of our "Homework" in my web class. It goes from the very basic <html> tags all the way to images and css and even a little javascript. I'm coming into this class already having practiced these topics. So I decided to pretty it up a little bit from the beginning. We also have a semester project I'm going to be posting on a seperate repo here on GitHub, and of course criticism is more than welcome. (The idea was to do the assignment exactly how they asked in the book, but I also wanted to expand on what I already knew how I threw in a little script to show off my own version)
